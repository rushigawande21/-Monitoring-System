# DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System

## Activity Title
Github-based QA Documentation and Problem Solving based on Electronics/Cross Domain Projects

---

## A. Program
The main program (`DHT_Code_PM.ino`) is included in this repository.  
It contains the Arduino source code for reading temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor and displaying them on the Serial Monitor at regular intervals.  
Refer to the program file for complete implementation details.

## B. Brief Description of the Code
This project implements a Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System using an Arduino UNO and a DHT11 sensor.  
The system continuously measures temperature (°C) and humidity (%) from the environment and displays the readings on the Serial Monitor every two seconds.

The code includes:
- Initialization of the DHT11 sensor using the Adafruit DHT library
- Stable data polling interval using a two-second delay
- Error handling with `isnan()` checks for invalid readings
- Structured comments for clarity and maintenance

This project serves as a foundational example of integrating sensors in embedded systems. It demonstrates how software development practices such as version control, issue tracking, and QA documentation can be applied in cross-domain (electronics + software) projects.

## C. QA Issues Logged
All QA issues identified during testing and review are documented under the **Issues** tab of this repository.  
Each issue includes a clear title, description, proposed fix, and resolution status.  
Screenshots and references to relevant commits are provided where applicable to ensure full traceability.

## D. Collaboration Summary
During the QA process, multiple GitHub Issues were created to identify and resolve software and documentation issues.  

Key collaboration activities included:
- Logging issues such as incorrect pin configuration, unstable readings, missing delay, and lack of documentation.
- Using comments under each issue to discuss causes, propose solutions, and document testing outcomes.
- Committing fixes with descriptive messages referencing the corresponding issue (e.g., `Fix #1: Added delay between readings`).
- Verifying each fix through testing before closing the issue.

This approach followed a systematic QA workflow and simulated a real-world collaborative development environment using GitHub's issue tracking and version control features.

## E. Learning Outcome
Through this activity, I learned to:
- Create and manage a GitHub repository for an embedded system project.
- Apply structured QA documentation and issue tracking using GitHub Issues.
- Collaborate through comments, commits, and issue-based workflows.
- Integrate software QA principles with hardware-based electronics development.
- Understand the importance of documentation, testing, and version control in professional engineering projects.

This exercise provided hands-on experience in combining software quality assurance practices with embedded systems, promoting cross-domain learning and professional development.
